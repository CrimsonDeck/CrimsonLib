# CrimsonLib Documentation

CrimsonLib is a C++ Console Library inspired by JavaScript and Python.

CrimsonLib takes C++'s hard learning curve and combines it with the simplicity of JavaScript and Python.

# print

print() outputs the text in the parentheses like iostream's "character out" (cout).


# read

read() takes in user input just like iostream's "character in" (cin).
